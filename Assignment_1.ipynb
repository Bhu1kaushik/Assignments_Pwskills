        "\n",
        "In conclusion, Python’s simplicity, versatility, and extensive library support make it a popular choice for programmers across different domains, from web development to data science.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2) Describe the role of pre-defined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Pre-defined keywords, also known as reserved words, play a crucial role in Python programming. These are special words that have a fixed meaning in the Python language and cannot be used for any other purpose, such as naming variables or functions. The main function of keywords is to define the structure and behaviour of Python code, as they are essential for implementing logic, control flow, error handling, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics of Keywords:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tReserved and Case-Sensitive: Keywords are reserved by the language and cannot be redefined. They are also case-sensitive, meaning True and true are different in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.\tDefine Code Structure: Keywords are used to define control structures (like loops and conditional statements), handle errors, declare functions and classes, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Commonly Used Keywords:\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tif, else, elif: Used for conditional statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\twhile, for: Used for looping and iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tdef, return: Used to define and return values from functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\ttry, except: Used for handling exceptions and errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tclass: Used to define a class in object-oriented programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tTrue, False, None: Represent Boolean values and a null object in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this way, predefined keywords ensure that Python code follows a structured and meaningful flow while providing specific functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3) Compare and Contrast mutable and immutable objects in python with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, objects are categorized as either mutable or immutable, depending on whether their value or state can be changed after creation. Understanding the difference between mutable and immutable objects is important as it affects how they behave in memory and how they interact in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable Objects\n",
        "Mutable objects are those whose value or internal state can be modified after the object is created. This means that any changes made to a mutable object are reflected directly in the same memory location, without creating a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Mutable Objects:\n",
        "1.\tLists:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "2.\tDictionaries:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dict[\"age\"] = 26  # Modifies the dictionary in place\n",
        "\n",
        "print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26}\n",
        "\n",
        "The value of the \"age\" key is modified within the same dictionary object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable Objects\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable objects, on the other hand, cannot be modified after they are created. If you attempt to change an immutable object, a new object will be created, and the original object remains unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Immutable Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tTuples:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "# my_tuple[0] = 4  # This would raise a TypeError as tuples are immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples cannot be altered. Any attempt to change an element will result in an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.\tStrings:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_string = \"hello\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# my_string[0] = \"H\"  # This would raise a TypeError\n",
        "\n",
        "new_string = my_string.upper()  # Returns a new string\n",
        "\n",
        "print(new_string)  # Output: \"HELLO\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(my_string)  # Output: \"hello\" (original string unchanged)\n",
        "\n",
        "While a new string \"HELLO\" is created, the original string \"hello\" remains unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Differences Between Mutable and Immutable Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tModifiability:\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tMutable objects (like lists, dictionaries, and sets) can be changed after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tImmutable objects (like strings, tuples, and integers) cannot be modified once created.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.\tMemory Behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tWhen a mutable object is modified, it is updated in place, meaning the memory address remains the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tWhen an immutable object is \"modified\" (e.g., concatenating strings), a new object is created, leading to a different memory address.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.\tPerformance and Use Case:\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tMutable objects are preferable when you need to modify the data frequently. However, this comes with the risk of unintentional changes if the object is referenced elsewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tImmutable objects are safer for concurrency (e.g., multi-threaded environments) because they cannot be altered, avoiding conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.\tExamples of Mutable Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tLists: list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tDictionaries: dict = {\"key\": \"value\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "o\tSets: set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "5.\tExamples of Immutable Objects:\n",

        "o\tIntegers: int = 5\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable and immutable objects serve different purposes in Python. Mutable objects allow changes in place, which can be efficient for specific tasks, while immutable objects ensure safety by preventing unintended modifications. Understanding the distinction helps in choosing the right data structures depending on the requirements of the program.\n",

        "Q4) Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans) In Python, operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. These operators fall into various categories, depending on the operation they perform.\n",

        "Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another in Python. This is often necessary when you want to perform operations between different data types or when you need to manipulate and process data in a specific format. Python provides built-in functions to handle type casting.\n",

        "Loops in Python are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, either for a fixed number of iterations or until a condition is met. The two main types of loops are for loops and while loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. for Loop\n",
        "The for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range) and executes code for each element.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "for fruit in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']:\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(fruit)\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Case: Ideal for when you know the number of iterations (e.g., looping through lists or ranges).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. while Loop\n",
        "\n",
        "The while loop keeps executing code as long as a condition remains True.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "counter = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "while counter < 3:\n",

        "•\tbreak: Exits the loop immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tcontinue: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "for i in range(5):\n",
        "\n",

        "In summary, for loops are for known iterations, while while loops are for conditional repetition, with control statements to manage loop behavior.\n",
